# Pygame-2D-Random-Fractals
Program made in Pygame for drawing randomly-generated fractals.
This program was originally made to imitate the shape of dielectric breakdown (such as lightning).

### To Run
1. Have Python installed
2. Have Pygame installed. (For windows, run `pip install pygame` in command prompt)
3. Run `pygame_2d_random_fractals.pyw`

### Controls
The controls are explained when the program is ran. (If the controls window gets in your way, it can be moved!)
In order to change the fractal presets, the Python file itself needs to be edited. The presets can be found near the top of the Python file.
